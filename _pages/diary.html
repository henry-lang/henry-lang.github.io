title: Henry's Diary

<h1>Henry's Diary</h1>
<p>Don't expect to find anything interesting here. I'm just writing down my thoughts and what I do each day, to both get better at writing and reference myself later in life.</p>
<p>Also, building this diary using Jekyll and Javascript was pretty fun: The calendar below you was actually a bit annoying to make.</p>

<div class="calendar-wrapper">
    <div class="calendar-month-container">
        <button class="calendar-change-month calendar-backwards">&lt;</button>
        <h1 class="calendar-month"></h1>
        <button class="calendar-change-month calendar-forwards">&gt;</button>
    </div>
    <ol class="calendar">
        <!-- Will be populated by calendar.js -->
    </ol>
</div>
